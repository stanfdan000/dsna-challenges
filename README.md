# DS&A Challenges

Each day this week we will be introducing you to different types of coding challenges you might recieve as part of a technical interview.

- [Day 1 - Primitives, List of Primitives, Functions & Recursion](./day-01/)
- [Day 2 - Big O, Stacks & Queues](./day-02/)
- [Day 3 - Node Based Data Structures (Trees & Linked Lists)](./day-03/)

Each day you are expected to complete some, but not all of the code challenges given. Read the rubrics carefully.
