# Big O Notation

By @dpcairns

`Big-O` can be tricky to understand. In short, Big-O asks: "does your function become more and more expensive when you feed it larger inputs (i.e. bigger arrays or data structures)?" In other words, to dramatically and unfairly oversimplify things: `Big-O` is just a measure of _how many times your function loops through an array_.

That means you can often eyeball a function's `Big-O` by looking whether your function has _loops inside loops_.

I will describe three kinds of Big-O:

1. Constant time: `O(1)`
2. Linear Time: `O(n)`
3. Quadratic Time: `O(n^2)`

If you are presented with a Big O question, chances are it will be one of these three. (See the link at the end for information about the fourth most common Big-O).

To determine which of these three it is, here are some questions to ask:

1. Does your function contain ZERO loops or does it loop the same number of times regardless of the input size?

   - Then your function probably is `Big-O(1)`.
   - No loops means the "operations" in your function only happens once.
   - Constant loops (such as doing something exactly 5 times) means that even if your array gets huge, the loop will still only happen 5 times.
   - We call this `constant time`, since no matter what you throw at your function, it will never always trigger the same number of operations.

2. Does your function loop through an array once?
   - If so, that's `Big-O(n)`.
   - That is to say, we do `n` operations, where `n` is the length of the array.
   - In an array of 5 things, a loop will do 5 operations. In an array of 8 things, a loop will do 8 operations.
   - We call this `linear time`.

Here's an example of `Big-O(n)`. Paste it in your browser console and count how many names log out.

```js
const dogs = ['jeep', 'spot', 'rover', 'spike', 'happy'];

for (let dog of dogs) {
  console.log(dog);
}
```

3. Does your function have a _loop inside your loop_?
   - If so, that might be `Big-O(n^2)`. Uh oh!
   - Loops inside loops are a classic Big-O red flag, and probably the most iconic Big-O no-no.

Here's an example of `Big-O(n^2)`. Paste it in your browser console and count how many names log out.:

```js
const dogs = ['jeep', 'spot', 'rover', 'spike', 'happy'];

for (let dog of dogs) {
  for (let dog of dogs) {
    // Notice that, for each item in the array, we loop through the whole array an additional time.
    // In `Big-O notation, this is called 'quadratic time'.
    // In big arrays, these extra start to really pile up!
    console.log(dog);
  }
}
```

Why is it called `Big-O(n^2)`? That sounds like math! I hear you. But let's break it down:

- In the `Big-O(n)` example, if you paste it in the console, you will see 5 dog names log out.
- In the `Big-O(n^2)` example, if you paste it in the console, you will see 25 dog names log out.
- Notice, that 5^2 (or 5 \* 5) is 25.
- Now, go back a few lines and wherever I said 5, replace it with `n`. That's where `n` and `n^2` come from!

If you can understand and describe these three Big-Os (`constant`, `linear`, and `quadratic`), you stand a good shot of nailing a Big-O question on an interview.
